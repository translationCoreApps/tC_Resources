  "28": "His breath is like an overflowing torrent that reaches up to the middle of the neck,\\q1 to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction. His breath is a bridle in the jaws of the peoples to cause them to wander away.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "29": "You will have a song as in the night when a holy feast is observed,\\q1 and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a flute to the mountain of Yahweh, to the Rock of Israel.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "30": "Yahweh will make the splendor of his voice heard and show the motion of his arm\\q1 in storming anger and flames of fire, with windstorm, rainstorm, and hailstones.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "31": "For at the voice of Yahweh, Assyria will be shattered; he will strike them with a staff.\\q1",
  "32": "Every stroke of the appointed rod that Yahweh will lay on them\\q1 will be accompanied with the music of tambourines and harps as he battles and fights with them.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "33": "For a place of burning was prepared long ago. Indeed, it is prepared for the king, and God has made it deep and wide.\\q1 The pile is ready with a fire and much wood.\n\\q1 The breath of Yahweh, like a stream of brimstone, will set it on fire."
