  "2": "It is a day of darkness and gloom,\\q a day of clouds and thick darkness.\n\\q Like the dawn that spreads on the mountains,\n\\q a large and mighty army is approaching.\n\\q There has never been an army like it,\n\\q and there never will be again,\n\\q even after many generations.\n\n\n\\q",
  "3": "A fire is consuming everything in front of it,\\q and behind it a flame is burning.\n\\q The land is like the garden of Eden in front of it,\n\\q but behind it there is a ruined wilderness.\n\\q Indeed, nothing will escape from it.\n\n\n\\q",
  "4": "The army's appearance is like horses,\\q and they run like horsemen.\n\\q",
  "5": "They jump with a noise like that of chariots on the tops of the mountains,\\q like the noise of fiery flames that devour the stubble,\n\\q like a mighty army ready for battle.\n\n\n\\q",

  "9": "They rush on the city,\\q they run on the wall,\n\\q they climb in the houses,\n\\q and they go through the windows like thieves.\n\n\n\\q",
  "10": "The earth shakes in front of them,\\q the heavens tremble,\n\\q the sun and the moon are darkened,\n\\q and the stars stop shining.\n\\q",
  "11": "Yahweh raises his voice in front of his army,\\q for his warriors are very numerous;\n\\q for they are strong, those who carry out his commands.\n\\q For the day of Yahweh is great and very terrible.\n\\q Who can survive it?\n\n\n\\q",

  "13": "Tear your heart and not only your garments,\\q and return to Yahweh your God.\n\\q For he is gracious and merciful,\n\\q slow to anger and abundant in covenant faithfulness,\n\\q and he would like to turn from inflicting punishment.\n\n\n\\q",
  "14": "Who knows? Will he perhaps turn and have compassion,\\q and leave a blessing behind him,\n\\q a grain offering and a drink offering for Yahweh your God?\n\n\n\\q",
