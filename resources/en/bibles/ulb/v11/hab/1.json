{"1":"The message that Habakkuk the prophet received,\\q","2":"\"Yahweh, how long shall I cry for help, and you will not hear?\\q I have cried out to you in horror, 'Violence!' but you will not save me.\n\n\n\\q","3":"Why do you make me see iniquity and look upon wrongdoing?\\q Destruction and violence are before me; there is strife, and contention rises up.\n\\q","4":"Therefore the law is weakened, and justice does not last for any time.\\q For the wicked surround the righteous; therefore false justice goes out.\"\n\n\n\n\\sp Yahweh replies to Habakkuk\n\\q","5":"\"Look at the nations and examine them; be amazed and astonished!\\q For I am surely about to do something in your days that you will not believe when it is reported to you.\n\\q","6":"For look! I am about to raise up the Chaldeans—that fierce and impetuous nation—\\q they are marching throughout the breadth of the land to seize homes that were not their own.\n\\q","7":"They are terrifying and fearsome; their judgment and splendor proceed from themselves.\n\n\\q","8":"Their horses also are swifter than leopards, quicker than the evening wolves.\\q So their horses stamp,\n\\q and their horsemen come from a great distance—they fly like an eagle hurrying to eat.\n\\q","9":"They all come for violence;\\q their multitudes go like the desert wind, and they gather captives like sand.\n\\f + \\ft The Hebrew text translated here as \\fqa their multitudes go like the desert wind \\fqa* is very difficult; many modern versions have other interpretations. \\f*\n\n\n\\q","10":"So they mock kings, and rulers are only a mockery for them.\\q They laugh at every stronghold, for they heap up earth and take them.\n\n\\q","11":"Then the wind will rush on; it will move past—guilty men, those whose might is their god.\"\n\n\n\\sp Habakkuk asks Yahweh another question\n\\q","12":"\"Are you not from ancient times, Yahweh my God, my Holy One? We will not die.\\q Yahweh has ordained them for judgment, and you, Rock, have established them for correction.\n\n\n\\q","13":"Your eyes are too pure to gaze upon evil, and you are not able to look on wrongdoing with favor;\\q why then have you looked favorably on those who betray?\n\\q Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than they are?\n\\q","14":"You make men like fish in the sea, like creeping things without a ruler over them.\n\n\\q","15":"He brings all of them up with a fishhook; \\q he drags men away in his fishnet;\n\\q he gathers them together in his dragnet; \n\\q so he rejoices and he is glad. \n\\q","16":"Therefore he sacrifices to his net \\q and burns incense to his dragnet,\n\\q for by his net he lives in luxury, \n\\q and his food is the richest kind.\n\\q","17":"Will he therefore keep emptying his net, \\q and will he continually slaughter the nations without mercy?\""}
