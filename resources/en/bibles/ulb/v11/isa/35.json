{"1":"The wilderness and the Arabah will be glad; and the desert will rejoice and blossom.\\q1 Like the rose,\n\\q1","2":"it will blossom abundantly and rejoice with joy and singing;\\q1 the glory of Lebanon will be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon;\n\\q1 they will see the glory of Yahweh, the splendor of our God.\n\n\n\\q1","3":"Strengthen the weak hands, and steady the knees that shake.\\q1","4":"Say to those with a fearful heart, \"Be strong, do not fear!\\q1 Look, your God will come with vengeance,\n\\q1 with the recompense of God. He will come and save you.\"\n\n\n\\q1","5":"Then the eyes of the blind will see, and the ears of the deaf will hear.\\q1","6":"Then the lame man will leap like a deer, and the mute tongue will sing,\\q1 for water breaks out in the Arabah, and streams in the wilderness.\n\\q1","7":"The burning sand will become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water;\\q1 in the habitation of jackals, where they once lay, will be grass with reeds and rushes.\n\n\n\\q1","8":"A highway will be there called The Holy Way.\\q1 The unclean will not travel it. But it will be for him who walks in it.\n\\q1 No fool will go on it.\n\\q1","9":"No lion will be there, no ferocious beast will be on it; they will not be found there,\\q1 but the redeemed will walk there.\n\n\n\\q1","10":"The ransomed of Yahweh will return\\q1 and come with singing to Zion, and everlasting joy will be on their heads;\n\\q1 gladness and joy will overtake them; sorrow and sighing will flee away."}
