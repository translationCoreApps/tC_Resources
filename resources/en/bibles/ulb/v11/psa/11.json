{"1":"I take refuge in Yahweh;\\q how will you say to me,\n\\q \"Flee like a bird to the mountain\"?\n\\q","2":"For see! The wicked prepare their bows.\\q They make ready their arrows on the strings\n\\q to shoot in the darkness at the upright in heart.\n\n\n\\q","3":"For if the foundations are ruined,\\q what can the righteous do?\n\\q","4":"Yahweh is in his holy temple;\\q his eyes watch, his eyes examine the children of mankind.\n\n\n\\q","5":"Yahweh examines both the righteous and the wicked,\\q but he hates those who love to do violence.\n\\q","6":"He rains burning coals and brimstone upon the wicked;\\q a scorching wind will be their portion from his cup!\n\\q","7":"For Yahweh is righteous, and he loves righteousness;\\q the upright will see his face."}
