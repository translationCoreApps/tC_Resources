{"1":"A fool says in his heart, \"There is no God.\"\\q They are corrupt and have done abominable iniquity;\n\\q there is no one who does good.\n\\q","2":"God looks down from heaven on the children of mankind\\q to see if there are any who understand,\n\\q who seek after him.\n\\q","3":"They have all turned away. Together they have become corrupt.\\q There is not one who does good, not even one.\n\n\n\\q","4":"Do those who commit iniquity have no understandingâ€”\\q those who devour my people as if they were eating bread\n\\q and they do not call on God?\n\\q","5":"They were in great fear, although no reason to fear was there;\\q for God will scatter the bones of whoever will camp against you;\n\\q such people will be put to shame because God has rejected them.\n\n\n\\q","6":"Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come from Zion!\\q When God brings back his people from the captivity,\n\\q then Jacob will rejoice and Israel will be glad!"}
