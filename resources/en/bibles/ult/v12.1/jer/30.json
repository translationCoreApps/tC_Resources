{"1":"The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,","2":"\"This is what Yahweh, God of Israel, says, 'Write in a scroll all the words that I have spoken to you.","3":"For look, days are coming—this is Yahweh's declaration—when I will restore the fortunes of my people, Israel and Judah. I, Yahweh, have said it. For I will bring them back to the land that I gave their ancestors, and they will possess it.'\"","4":"These are the words that Yahweh declared concerning Israel and Judah,","5":"\"For Yahweh says this,\\q 'We have heard a trembling voice of dread and not of peace.\n\n\n\\q","6":"Ask and see if a man bears a child.\\q Why do I see every young man with his hand on his loins like a woman bearing a child?\n\\q Why have all their faces become pale?\n\\q","7":"Woe! For that day will be great, with none like it.\\q It will be a time of anxiety for Jacob, but he will be rescued from it.\n\n\n\\q","8":"For it will be in that day—this is the declaration of Yahweh of hosts—that I will break the yoke off your neck, and I will shatter your chains, so foreigners will no longer enslave you.\\q","9":"But they will worship Yahweh their God and serve David their king, whom I will make king over them.\n\n\\q","10":"So you, my servant Jacob, do not fear—this is Yahweh's declaration—and do not be dismayed, Israel.\\q For see, I am about to bring you back from far away, and your descendants from the land of captivity.\n\\q Jacob will return and be at peace; he will be secure, and there will be no more terror.\n\\q","11":"For I am with you—this is Yahweh's declaration—to save you. Then I will bring a complete end\\q to all the nations where I have scattered you. But I will certainly not put an end to you,\n\\q though I discipline you justly and will certainly not leave you unpunished.'\n\n\n\\q","12":"For Yahweh says this, 'Your injury is incurable; your wound is infected.\\q","13":"There is no one to plead your case; there is no remedy for your wound to heal you.\n\n\\q","14":"All of your lovers have forgotten you. They will not look for you,\\q for I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy and the discipline of a cruel master\n\\q because of your many iniquities and your innumerable sins.\n\\q","15":"Why do you call for help for your injury? Your pain is incurable.\\q Because of your many iniquities, your innumerable sins, I have done these things to you.\n\n\n\\q","16":"So everyone who consumes you will be consumed, and all of your adversaries will go into captivity.\\q For the ones who have plundered you will become plunder, and I will make all of the ones despoiling you a spoil.\n\\q","17":"For I will bring healing on you; I will heal you of your wounds—this is Yahweh's declaration—\\q I will do this because they called you: Outcast. No one cares for this Zion.'\"\n\n\n\\q","18":"Yahweh says this, \"See, I am about to bring back the fortunes of Jacob's tents and have compassion on his homes.\\q Then a city will be built on the heap of ruins, and a stronghold will exist again where it used to be.\n\\q","19":"Then a song of praise and a sound of merriment will go out from them,\\q for I will increase them and not diminish them; I will honor them so they will not be humbled.\n\n\n\n\\q","20":"Then their people will be like before, and their assembly will be established before me\\q when I punish all the ones who are now tormenting them.\n\\q","21":"Their leader will come from among them. He will emerge from their midst\\q when I draw him near and when he approaches me.\n\\q If I do not do this, who would dare come close to me?—this is Yahweh's declaration.\n\\q","22":"Then you will be my people, and I will be your God.\n\n\\q","23":"See, the tempest of Yahweh, his fury, has gone out. It is a continual tempest.\\q It will whirl on the heads of the wicked people.\n\\q","24":"Yahweh's wrath will not return until it has carried out and brought into being his heart's intentions.\\q In the final days, you will understand it.\""}
