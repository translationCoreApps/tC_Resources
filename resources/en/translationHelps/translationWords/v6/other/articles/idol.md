# idol, idolatrous #

## Definition: ##

An idol is an object that people make so they can worship it. Something is described as "idolatrous" if it involves giving honor to something other than the one true God.

* People make idols to represent the false gods that they worship.
* These false gods do not exist; there is no God besides Yahweh.
* Sometimes demons work through an idol to make it seem like it has power, even though it does not.
* Idols are often made of valuable materials like gold, silver, bronze, or expensive wood.
* An "idolatrous kingdom" means a "kingdom of people who worship idols" or a "kingdom of people who worship earthly things."
* The term "idolatrous figure" is another word for a "carved image" or an "idol."
