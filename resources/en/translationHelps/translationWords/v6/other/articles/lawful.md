# lawful, lawfully, unlawful #

## Definition: ##

The term "lawful" refers to something that is permitted to be done according to a law or other requirement. The opposite of this is "unlawful," which simply means "not lawful." 

* In the Bible, something was "lawful" if it was permitted by God's moral law, or by the Law of Moses and other Jewish laws. Something that was "unlawful" was "not permitted" by those laws.
* To do something "lawfully" means to do it "properly" or "in the right way."
* Many of the things that the Jewish laws considered lawful or not lawful were not in agreement with God's laws about loving others.
* Depending on the context, ways to translate "lawful" could include "permitted" or "according to God's law" or "following our laws" or "proper" or "fitting."
* The phrase "Is it lawful?" could also be translated as "Do our laws allow?" or "Is that something our laws permit?"
